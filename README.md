# 📊 Sales Trends Analysis – Python Project

## 📁 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can support business decisions. It simulates real-world data analysis tasks using Python and popular libraries.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from [Kaggle / DataMites / OpenML etc.] and includes fields like Date, Product, Sales Volume, and Revenue.

## 📌 Objectives
- Clean and prepare raw sales data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends over time and across categories
- Identify key products and periods of high/low performance

## 📈 Key Insights
- [Example] Sales peaked during Q4 across all regions  
- [Example] Product A consistently outperforms others in revenue  
- [Example] Missing values were concentrated in Region and Date columns

## 🔍 What I Learned
- How to clean messy data using Pandas  
- Visual storytelling with Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Drawing actionable business insights from data — bridging my background in Procurement & Customer Relations with Data Science  

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Build predictive models (forecasting) in future versions  
- Compare performance across years  
- Integrate more business KPIs for decision-making
